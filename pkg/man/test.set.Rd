\title{Produce a report from multiple test results}
\description{
 Turns multiple test results into a report of assertions that passed, organized by function being tested}
\usage{
  test.set(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{A single list of \code{test} return values or multiple arguments each evaluating to a test return value.}
  }
\details{
Gathers results from a number of tests, passed as two or more arguments or a single list thereof and produces a function-centric report. Which functions are tested by a test is determined based on the argument \code{about} of function \code{\link{test}}. The function is named generically \code{test.set} and may get additional or different features in the future that are also related to running multiple tests as a group, such as overall statistics.}

\value{A list of lists of assertions, each element of the outer list named after a function that was tested in each of the assertions contained in that element. When tests are particurarly thorough it is possible to think of each element as a specification for one function.}

\examples{
  test.set(
    test(function(x = rdouble(10)) {all(x + 0 == x)}, about = '+'),
    test(forall(x = rdouble(10), y = rdouble(size = ~length(x)), all(x + y == y + x)), about = '+'))
}
